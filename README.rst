justgiving_totaliser
===============================

Totaliser for JustGiving pages. Incredibly fragile! No idea how it will behave if your locale isn't English, for example.


Features
--------

* Scrapes a JustGiving page
* Displays windows showing:
  - a simple bar showing the progress towards the total
  - the most recent donor's name, donation amount and comment
  - recent donors' names and donation amounts in a list
  - recent donors' names, donation amounts, and comments in a marquee


Limitations
-----------

* Only works for JustGiving "pages", not for "campaigns", "crowdfundings", etc.
